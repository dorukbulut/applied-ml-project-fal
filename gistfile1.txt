# Applied ML Project

Implement a FLUX.1 [dev] fal serverless application.

Use https://docs.fal.ai/private-serverless-apps to get started.

The application should have a route for text to image and a route for image to image. Additionally, it should have a modification to attention mechanism. 

We want to combine the ideas of Perturbed Attention Guidance and Normalized Attention Guidance in the following ways:
- Like NAG, we will compute feature vectors, combine them with weight parameter and normalize them.
- Unlike NAG, but like the PAG, the "negative" attention map will be an identity matrix and not based on a negative prompt.

Goals for the ~2 day trial:
- A working application that can be deployed to a serverless platform.
- Error handling and helpful error messages.
- Our novel NAG/PAG option.

Extra goals (plus points, if not completed we might tackle one of them at on-site):
- Improve the speed. 
- Extend the pipeline with additional functionality.
