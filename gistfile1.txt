# Applied ML Project

Implement a FLUX.1 [dev] fal serverless application.

Use https://docs.fal.ai/private-serverless-apps to get started.

The application should have a route for text to image and a route for image to image.

Goals for the ~2 day trial:
- A working application that can be deployed to a serverless platform.
- Error handling and helpful error messages.

Extra goals (plus points, if not completed we might tackle one of them at on-site):
- Improve the speed. 
- Improve the quality with training free modifications.
- Add additional functionality to the pipeline.
